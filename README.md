How it works:
You can create new modules by button in left-top part of the screen. (Firstly you should enter type of the module, it can be Num or Plus)
Then you can drag the modules my clicking and moving. Also you can create a new connection by double click, after that you should
move a cursor to one from other moudles and click on it. Then you can see result :)

Also you can set a value of Num in second textbox.
